This is the beginning of a python-based host software for reprap printers.

Currently contains printcore.py, which requires pyserial to be installed.

Using printcore:

p=printcore('/dev/ttyUSB0',115200)
p.startprint(data) # data is an array of gcode lines
p.send_now("M105") # sends M105 as soon as possible
p.pause()
p.resume()
p.disconnect()
